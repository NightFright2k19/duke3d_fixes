This file provides widescreen graphics to make Duke Nukem 3D look a bit more polished and 
visually "complete" for EDuke32 users.

What you get:
-------------
> Fixed game.con
  Darkus released an edited game.con file on Oct 3, 2016 which applies many improvements
  and adjustments to the game, such as:
     + Kill counter fix: Should now work as intended, works differently in 'Damn I'm Good', 
                         skill settings also applied to some monsters (e.g. slimer eggs).
     + Tons of code corrections, e.g. attacking shrunk enemies crouching monsters now have 
       correct sizes, some animation tweaks, some cosmetic changes (green blood for eggs, 
       rotating turrets actually rotating).
     + Fixed shrinker: Large sprites can be shrunk now without issues.
     + It is now possible to spawn any colored monster by using a paletted RESPAWN sprite.
     + Multiplayer items in coop mode removed. 
     + Changes for specific enemies:
          - Bosses: Reduced rocket damage for mini-bosses, removed self-damage.
          - Commander: Can respawn in 'Damn I'm Good', removed self-damage (can still hit 
                       each other).
          - Drone: Now checks if player can be seen before detonating. Also found that 
                   the drone is supposed to play a beeping sound before exploding which 
                   never happens due to malformed code. It is still disabled by default, 
                   but you can try it by editing game.con - just search for the two 
                   'state checkdronenearplayer' entries).
          - Organtic Turret: Coded and works better, but still not perfect and lacks sounds.
          - Pig Cops: when hit, shooting animation is not reset (was pretty annoying, 
                      especially when you shoot them with a rapid fire weapon).
          - Pig Cop Tank: Implemented more realistic physics for movements.
          - Protector Drone: Reduced clipping distance which allows better moving in 
                             narrow areas, also more aggressive underwater.
                             Palette fixes: Has now green blood and correct color is restored 
                             after being frozen. When unfrozen, Drone now has correct behavior
                             (no more issues with changing direction).
          - Protozoid Slimer: Floor shadows removed.
          - Recon vehicle: Can now be created using RESPAWN sprite, thus fixing the "missing 
                           monster" bug in E1L2. Also removed blood (vehicles are not 
                           supposed to bleed).
          - Slimer Eggs: Avoids resetting behavior after being frozen or shrunk, can also 
                         be created using the respawn sprite.
          - Trooper: Can be spawned with different colors using the RESPAWN sprite as intended 
                     in stock maps
          - Turret: Removed floor shadow for ceiling turrets (floor turrets still have).
      + Changes for other sprites:
          - FEM2 and FEM6 are now displaying the correct sprite after being killed.
          - Sharks are now counting as enemy while the cannon (tile #1810) is not counted 
            as enemy anymore.
          - Some breakable sprites are 'active' at map start. This restores the behavior 
            from v1.3D in E1L4 when barrels are moving on conveyor belts at map start 
            (also in E4L9).

> 8-bit redfont from Duke3D v1.3D
  With the Atomic Edition, 3D Realms switched to a new menu font that was much thicker
  than the one that came with the initial release of the game. Many liked the previous
  font better, so here it is. I basically took the 8-bit version of the redfont from
  the HRP and added it as a standalone (without its highres counterpart).

> Widescreen statusbar and weapons
  Fox made a really nice widescreen statusbar for the game. I improved a few pixels here
  and there and increased its width a bit to cover higher screen resolutions.
  Widescreen-compatible weapons for Duke Nukem 3D (Pistol, Shrinker, Expander) and
  Life's A Beach (Water Pistol, Super Soak'em, Triple Poison Shooter) made by Jimmy are also
  included, only loaded when the same tiles are not replaced by custom mods.

- EDuke32 (use a recent snapshot from: http://dukeworld.duke4.net/eduke32 )

1) Extract "duke3d_fix.zip" into your EDuke32 autoload dir.

2) Make sure "Enable 'autoload' folder" option is checked in EDuke32 launcher. 

3) Launch EDuke32.

N O T E S
================================================================================================

1) This patch is meant for users who prefer to play without the Highres Pack (HRP).
   Using the HRP and this at the same time is redundant as you would have highres replacements 
   for statusbar and menu font which make the graphics provided with this file useless.

2) There seem to be issues with Darkus' GAME.CON fix and certain user maps such as 
   underTaker's "Blink of an Eye" (maps ends right after being loaded). If you can't wait
   for a fix, rename game.con in this pack to restore the original version.
